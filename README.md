## Welcome to the **dbt Fundamentals with Databricks** project!

### Who is this repo for?
This repo is specifically made for Gjensidige employees attending the dbt-fundamentals course. This repo contains the code meant for the sample data configured in Databricks, which deviate from the videos provided by dbtLabs (Snowflake). Hopefully this repo will get you unstuck if you run into trouble while following the video-course.

### What is jaffle_shop?
The jaffle_shop is a fictional ecommerce store. This dbt project transforms raw data from an app database into a customers and orders model ready for analytics.

### What is a jaffle?
A jaffle is a toasted sandwich with crimped, sealed edges. Invented in Bondi in 1949, the humble jaffle is an Australian classic. The sealed edges allow jaffle-eaters to enjoy liquid fillings inside the sandwich, which reach temperatures close to the core of the earth during cooking. Often consumed at home after a night out, the most classic filling is tinned spaghetti, while my personal favourite is leftover beef stew with melted cheese.
